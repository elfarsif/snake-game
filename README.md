# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. Below is an overview of the game and its features.

## Features

1. **Game Controls**: Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right). Press the spacebar to start the game.
   
2. **Scoring**: The score is displayed on the top left corner of the screen. Each time the snake eats food, the score increases by one. The high score achieved in the session is displayed on the top right corner.

3. **Gameplay**: The game starts with a single snake segment. As the snake eats food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the game board.

4. **Speed Increase**: As the snake eats food, the speed of the game increases gradually, making it more challenging.

## How to Play

1. **Start**: Press the spacebar to start the game.
   
2. **Control**: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
   
3. **Objective**: Eat as much food as possible to increase your score. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself.
   
4. **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the game board.

## How It Was Built

The game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of the components:

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the game board and elements like the score display and instruction text.
   
- **CSS**: Provides styling to the game elements, including the game board, snake, food, and scores.
   
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, including controlling the snake's movement, generating food, detecting collisions, updating scores, and managing game speed.

The game utilizes grid-based positioning for the snake and food elements, allowing for smooth movement and collision detection.
